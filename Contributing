Contributions are welcomed and encouraged. I work on adding features to this framework when I can as I use it for most of my games I make. But if you enjoy it as well, any improvements are welcomed.

# Contribution Guidelines

All contributions should be made as a pull request to the main branch.

## Merge Requirements
- dotnet build successful
- 1 review by an authorized member (currently that's exclusively QueenOfSquiggles)

## Style Guide

The style is enforced through a combination of ChickensoftGames's `.editorconfig` file for C# development as well as using `TreatWarningsAsErrors` in the csproj file. What this means is that if your PR passes the `dotnet build` test, you're doing just fine.

## Requesting features

If you are looking for a certain feature and would like to request it, for now the only method is to open an issue. However, I reserve the right to reject any particular requests as some things are going to be extremely difficult for me to accomplish, if they are possible at all. 

I do everything I can to make this tool as useful and powerful as I can, while providing it freely to you under the MIT license. But I do have a lot of stuff on my plate (and if I ever think I don't it means I forgot something big!) so your patience is greatly apprecaited.
