# Third Party Integrations

These folders will contain all third party integrations for SC4X. These individual modules may have their own dependencies or not, but they are also able to be purged from the project with no knock-on effects across SC4X.

## Current Integrations

### Discord Rich Presence
Utilizes `DiscordRichPresence` package to implement [Discord Rich Presence](https://discord.com/developers/docs/rich-presence/best-practices) for your game, which allows metadata of the play session to be sent to the player's active discord client which is then viewable to anyone who they are set to share their rich presence status with.
