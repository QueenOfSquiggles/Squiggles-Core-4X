/// The launch sequence is a controlled animation sequence that plays on startup. With default settings, it will always play on first launch. Then there will be <see cref="_chanceDoAnyway"/> (default 25%) chance to play it on subsequent launches. In debug builds (expected for editing and development) it is skipped unless <see cref="_testing"/> is true, in which case it will always show. Additionally, in a "demo" context it will always play regardless of whether its the first session. This is considered a small penalty for playing the demo version as, usually, a demo isn't something that you play for more than a handfull of sessions (if more than just one!)
